              Since probably before the dawn of homo-sapien earthlings have gazed into the night sky and wondered what is out there in the cosmos.
              Our imagination has let us travel throughout the milky way and onwards but only in spirit. 
              Confined to our home planet we have often yearned of adventure outside.
              Luni would like make it ever farther in this expansion if only bit by bit.

          Luni is progressing towards a stable pathway to full colonization of our moon even if its means baby steps.
          The universe is a dangerous place but somebody's got to explore it and since we don't know of any other species interested at the moment it might as well be us starting with the moon.
          This is no easy task however, the obstacles are numerous some we are aware of and some we can't really get a full grasp on until we start sending people there long term but Luni wants to pave the way by providing commercial flights to our moon for a quick visit.
          We believe this will spark more innovation and interest into making our way out into space and in time extending way beyond our closest celestial neighbor.<br><br>

          Life as we know it keeps most of it's eggs in one basket here on earth meaning if at any time an existential catastrophy were to strike and destroy the the earth, well, that would surely take out most forms of life including humans.
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade">Tardargrades</a> or "water bears" may survive they are pretty hardy which would be cool all things considered but maybe boring after awhile.  
          Ensuring humanity has some existential safety nets is vital in our opinion and probably yours also we would think.
          Which is why we are starting with flights to the moon in hopes that one day some of us will call it home.
